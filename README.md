# Crypto
Practicing Encryption/Decryption Algorithms

## This repository will consist of a self project in which i will attempt to:
  *  - [ ] Create a program that can encrypt sentences with basic algorithms
  *  - [ ] Create a program that can decrypt sentences with basic algorithms
  *  - [ ] Improve the encryption program to more advanced algorithms
  *  - [ ] Improve the decryption program to more advanced algorithms
  *  - [ ] Develop a key-sharing algorithm implementation?

## Milestone Log

2021/11/08
  * Skeleton code written to take user input, clean it and call algorithm depending on user request
  * Currently, user input accepted for plaintext is limited to alphabet and basic punctuation incl. `\n ( ) , . ? ! ;`
  * User input is cleaned as follows:
    * All characters capitalised
    * All punctuation removed
    * All spaces removed
  * Need to update to allow punctuation and numbers to be included in plaintext before the encryption algorithms are written
